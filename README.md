The attached files contain research data collected from high school students at SMA Global Mandiri Cibubur who have low mathematical abilities. The data includes the following:

Descriptive Statistics and Normality Test (Descriptive Statistics and Normality Test.pdf) – Contains descriptive statistical analysis to summarize the characteristics of the data, along with normality test results to determine whether the data follows a normal distribution.

Homogeneity Test (Homogeneity test.xlsx) – Includes the results of the homogeneity test, which assesses whether the variances of the groups being compared are equal, ensuring the validity of further statistical analyses.

Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.pdf) – Presents the results of a non-parametric statistical test used to compare paired samples (e.g., pre-test and post-test scores) when the data does not meet normality assumptions.

Raw Data of Pre-test and Post-test (Raw Data Pre-test and Post-test.xlsx) – Contains the original data collected before (pre-test) and after (post-test) an intervention, allowing for detailed analysis and comparison of student performance.

This dataset provides insights into the mathematical abilities of students with low performance and supports evidence-based conclusions regarding their learning progress.
